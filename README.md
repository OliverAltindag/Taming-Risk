This project contains my research paper, Taming Risk, and its accompanying Jupyter Notebook. Enjoy!

Here is the Abstract:

We look to optimize the weighting of any portfolio of stocks, in the S\&P 500, by maximizing the Sharpe Ratio: we limit the covariance (risk) of the portfolio while maintaining accelerated return rates using gradient-based non-linear optimization, followed by a downstream Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) forecasting model. In development, we utilized 3 years of historical data from 2020-2023 and multiple randomly selected portfolios to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for the weight of each stock. We then compared the initial portfolios to the optimized portfolios' predicted Sharpe Ratio in 2025. We find that our model consistently outperforms the initial weights, both in long-term and quarterly gains.
